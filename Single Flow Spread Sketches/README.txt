Steps for execution:
--------------------
1. Once the zip file is extracted scoure code can be found inside src folder

2. Open terminal and cd to .../src directory

3. In terminal enter the following commands:
	a) javac SingleFlowSpreadSketches.java
	b) java SingleFlowSpreadSketches

4. You will prompted to enter bitmap size, propability for Probabilistic BitMap, number of registers for HyperLoglog

5. Once the execution completes following three files will be generated:
	a) bitmap.txt -- Report for BitMap
	b) probabilisticBitMap.txt -- Report for probabilisticBitMap
	c) hyperLoglog.txt -- Report for hyperLoglog 
	
Report Description
------------------

1. bitmap.txt:
	Contains five lines each representing actual and estimated flow size

2. probabilisticBitMap.txt:
	Contains five lines each representing actual and estimated flow size
	
3. hyperLoglog.txt:
	Contains four lines each representing actual and estimated flow size
